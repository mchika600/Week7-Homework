<h1>Brief History on Classes</h1>
<blockquote>
        A class is a type of function, but instead of using the keyword function
        to initiate it, we use the keyword class, and the properties is assigned
        inside a constructor() method. Use the keyword class to create a class,
        and always add a constructor method. The constructor method is called each
        time the class object is initialized.
